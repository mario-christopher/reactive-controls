# Angular Reactive Controls - Taking it to the Next Level !

An Angular Project that helps make the most of Reactive Forms and Controls.
The code is presented in 5 sections or code folders:

---
### Intro

This section introduces the basic, out-of-the-box, reactive forms and controls in Angular. It probably represents the first set of exercises one would work through when getting to know Angular Reactive Forms.

---
### Simple Form
This section moves to the next level, in adding more value to the Forms, with the introduction of bells and whistles that would accompany any self-respecting Form - such as Labels, Hints, Error Messages, Colored borders, Validators etc.

---
### Using Fields
Here, this section introduces optimization - extracting and encapsulating repetetive code inside custom controls. Also the workings of a Control-Value-Accessor is shown here.

---
### Extending
This section deals with the true Next-Level of Angular Forms and Controls - extending the boring, default FormGroup and FormControl to a more specialized set of Controls - Textbox, Checkbox, Radionbutton, Dropdown, Grid etc.

---
### Next
This section talks about - What's next ? Where can we go from here ? How to improvise further ? etc.
